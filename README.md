1. Real-Time Collaboration (WebSockets or Liveblocks)
Multiple users can draw on the same canvas simultaneously and see each other’s strokes live.
Think Google Docs for sketching — this will make your app stand out instantly.
Tech stack: Socket.IO, Liveblocks, or Supabase Realtime.

2. Cloud Storage & Version History
Save each sketch to a backend (e.g., MongoDB GridFS, AWS S3, or Supabase Storage) instead of only downloading locally.
Add version history so users can roll back to earlier saves.
You instantly go from “toy app” to “professional design tool.”

3. Authentication & Personal Workspaces
Add secure login with JWT or OAuth (e.g., Google, GitHub).
Each user gets their own saved sketches, shared projects, and permissions for editing.
Integrates perfectly with real-time collab + cloud saves for a full SaaS experience.
